              <p><strong>Introducing Crash Detection. Help on automatic.</strong> <br> For the first time, Apple Watch Series 8 is able to detect if you’re in a severe car crash. When a crash is detected, Crash Detection can automatically connect you with emergency services, provide dispatchers with your location, and notify your emergency contacts. Crash Detection uses the combined power of an improved 3-axis gyroscope and a new g-force accelerometer that has the highest dynamic range in any smartwatch. It also uses a microphone, barometer, GPS, and an advanced sensor-fusion algorithm trained on over 1 million hours of real-world driving and crash data to detect if you're in a severe crash.
